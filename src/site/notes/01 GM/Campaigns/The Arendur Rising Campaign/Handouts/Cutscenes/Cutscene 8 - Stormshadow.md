# Audience of Stormshadow - Cutscene #8

An 8 foot tall blue scaled dragonborn, clad in rich cloth, walks into a dark cave. A few torches burn with purple light up against the walls, a faint mist rolls around the cave. The distinct sweet smell of rot hangs in the air and faint moans of spirits from the shadowrealm tease the edges of reality here.

The one titled "Warmaster" kneels in a glowing circle filled with mysterious arcane runes, infront of it stands a huge figure mostly hidden in the shadows. "Master Stormshadow, despite minor setbacks, the plan is in motion. We march on Arendur, Ghostlord will soon be ready and Saarvith is overseeing the final stages of the project in Blackspear."

A deep gruff voice rolls against the walls "Good, good. I trust my goblin army suits you well, the gifts of my patron splendidly empowering them. I am preparing for my ritual, the prize for my patron's aid must be paid. My advisor tells me, no doubt much like our goblin spies, that the kingdom of humanity is in a political disarray. Our dragons, giants and goblinkin shall overrun their disorganised attempt at defense." a crunching sound rise from Stormshadow and a small spark of green light illuminates the cave infront of him, where a dark shade of a man hangs in midair. The shade looks humble, yet "Warmaster" gets the feeling that it is a facade, this spirit is anything but humble.

"I trust you can handle the siege of Arendur without me and mine, we do not want to reveal ourselves just yet. Everything must be just right." Stormshadow spreads out his arms wide and filles the air with dust from bones he just crushed and sniffs deeply. "My goblin warlocks will soon begin summoning Meg's monsters and I shall open the gate for her cyclopedian garde in the Fane of misery that "Ripper" has cleared out."

Stormshadow turns around and "Warmaster" lowers his gaze "Meg evil eye, my patron has no real interrest in our struggles, we must not squander her gifts. It is only because i pay the tithe demanded and that means souls. We must harvest as many as possible "Warmaster".

Stormshadow turns around again and begins talking with the shade "Your insights have proven most helpful, i do not think we could have done any of this without you. Soon the pitiful humans will learn who the rightful masters of Diamor is."

Casually Stormshadow says over his shoulder "Warmaster, i almost forgot, i did not summon you here to dote on our masterful plans. I heard we did not harvest many souls in Telions, our first conquest?"

Jawbreakers hand twitched alittle, he had thought this might be why "No, Master, we did not. The town was evacuated before we got there. I am still gathering various information but it seems the same company of adventurers that slain Ratbag, cleared the sunken citadel and broke the Skull Bridge also convinced the town to flee before we got there".

A deep sigh from Stormshadow "We need souls Warmaster, or my patron might decide we are not worth her time and effort. Take care of these heroes" the last words was drawn out with espaperation "I thought we had cleared most of them out already?". Jawbreaker clenched his jaws "We have managed to wipe out several groups of Arendurs lodge members, all but the insignificant ones. These must have slipped under our gaze, I have already issued a kill squad, they are marked for death. And we have eyes in a few towns and in Arendur itself. They shall not disrupt our plans any further."

"Good, i knew there was a reason i entrusted my secret goblin army to a mighty champion of.. HER.. ." Stormshadows voice shifted from soft velvet to cracking of stone "It is a pity i cannot watch Arendur crack, i have little choice the work here must be done."
