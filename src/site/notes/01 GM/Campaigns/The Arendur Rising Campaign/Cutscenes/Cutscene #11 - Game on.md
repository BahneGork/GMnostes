# Game on - Cutscene #11

Elsewhere in utter darkness a voice creaks like an old haunted house "The pieces are in motion, opening moves over, now the game begins."

Another voice joins the conversation like a queen calming her children "They might manuever their defences now, but see the prize they are willing to pay. Arrogance, the absolute faith in his power is almost befitting of our cause. I wonder... you know the ruby prison is but one weapon, what if we could turn HIM?"

The first voice responds with a snort "forget it, he is of the black orb, while they are selfcentered enough they still believe in structure and order and laws, if only to keep them in power. They do not believe in the right of might. No, once his obsidian spear is done his strongest player will be in the game. See how they all flock to his meatgrinder, none the wiser. Our preparations are strong, but it will be easier if this plan of his fails, if he does not manifest."

"Perhaps, these rogue agents will get in his way. Mortals often prevail in the face of great adversity after all. Over and over and over again, struggle and strife, such eternal entertainment. Yet even should he claim control and campaign against our cults, he will only delay us, we have shrouded our greatest weapon even from him who so loves to covet what others know. He might think he knows what's coming, but two can play his game of secrets, she will be free once again."

the hoarse croaking replies "You put too much stock in that one i think. I have a backup im working on, if the incursion fails once again. Maybe it's time for a do over.... "

"no... i was just getting fond of that world."
