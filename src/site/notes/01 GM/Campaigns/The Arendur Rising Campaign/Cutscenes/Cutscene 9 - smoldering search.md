# Smoldering search - cutscene #9

Teslions, trade town on the edge of Urisa, formerly a bubbling place of merchants travelling in and out of Ursia, now a ghost town. The town still had smoldering ashes from where buildings had been burned down. The smoke was not so oppressive as it probably had been days before. A lone figure was wandering amongst the rubble of the town, turning over various things as if searching for something.

The woman with tar black dreadlocks and bright red eyes, spends many hours amongst the ruins of Teslions, until she walks to the river and stares across it. After standing perfectly still for a minute the woman levitates a foot off the ground and floats across the river as she utters "Qa'tek in pursuit, crystal warrior targeted."
