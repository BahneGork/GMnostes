*Sod this! -* he thought to himself as he felt every biting sting of his wounds, one more lucky cut or some nasty dwarf magic and he would be dead and nobody would know the portal would fail. He had a newfound hatred of Dwarves, *hells that hammer hurt!* Scabnose looked at Zarrkle the warlock goblin lying dead on the cavern floor, the skulls of the hangmantree effigy floating in the air and the fomorian giant trying to get through the portal. *Sod this* he thought again. *Bitarri sent Sunkiller to Jawbreaker to report* he had heard her give the order before she ran to her pool, she would sod off to Blackspear castle, leave them here to die.

Scabnose gathered his strength and set his mind to sprinting all he could, there was that narrow almost invisible passage into "the rift". If he could get past the nasty adventurers, he could get out, the crawl vines were not far from the rift. He eyed his moment and ran all he could muster, *sod this, sod them!*

He found the narrow passage and pushed through the rock wall, *Yes!* He ran some more, into the crawl vine room and climbed up to the upperfloor of the citadel. He was immediately challenged by the guards posted at the top and when he told them his story everyone began hustling. The corrupted goblins, with all their mysterious growths, gathered their belongings and began shouting and calling alarms gathering the survivors of the Citadel.

"We go to Skull Bridge boys, get message to Cinder Hill. Sunkiller has left for Jawbreaker, but we can get word to Warchief Slythe. If they follow us, Ozzy will take care of them at the bridge." Scabnose instructed the gathering soldiers, he was all there was left of any kind of commander now. No shamans, no warlocks, no chiefs.. Just him, Slythe would reward him for bringing word for sure.

The twenty some goblins headed for the cracked Citadel wall that opened up near the ancient staircase up to the floor of the blackwoods forest. As they hustled up the staircase Scabnose looked up to check if the adventurers had come down this way and removed their ropes, they hadn't. He looked back over his shoulder towards the small courtyard they had ignored, the exit Moogzt had used when that ambitious bunch of goblins had wanted to press further inland. They must have met the adventurers and they had backtracked the goblins here. *Curse you Moogzt!* *To the nine hells with you!*

The red hand soldiers scrambled up from the crevasse in the blackwoods and disappeared into the undergrowth, headed west towards Skull Bridge. As he ran with his boys Scabnose thought to himself *I will hurt you back Dwarf, i will break your skull and your sodding hammer.* A voice whispered in his mind *Scab, Scabby..* He thought he smelled sulfur for a moment *Scabby, I can help you, lets make a deal* the voice whispered..
