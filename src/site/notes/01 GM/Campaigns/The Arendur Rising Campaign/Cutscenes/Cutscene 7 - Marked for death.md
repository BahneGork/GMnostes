"No corpses? No souls?!!" a deep voice like boulders cracking against each other "What is the meaning of this Warmaster?!"

"Unfortunately a group of adventurers managed to get the first town to evacuate before our horde descended upon it." The warmasters jaws were clenching ever so fiercely.

"What!? The plan was always to rid the world of those pestering adventurers of the lodge, how are they not dealt with?!"

"Master Stormshadow, we have dealt with all the major adventurers, it is only insignificant ones left. But I have marked them for death, we have kill squads out looking for them, they shall die soon enough." Jawbreaker looked down and tensed, he knew this was a bad start for the campaign.

"Get this dealt with warmaster, now leave me i must continue the ritual, the fane must be maintained. Grail, come, i need your council. Warmaster, i do not want to hear about nosy adventurers no more, understand? Now leave us."
