# Cutscenes Folder

This folder contains narrative cutscenes that are delivered to players between sessions, typically via email or other communication channels.

## What are Cutscenes?

Cutscenes are narrative handouts about off-stage events - things happening in the world that the PCs aren't present for, but which inform the larger story and create dramatic tension.

## Naming Convention

Files should be named: `Cutscene [#] - [Brief Description].md`

Examples:
- `Cutscene 11 - The Search and Game On.md`
- `Cutscene 12 - Red Hand Mobilizes.md`
- `Cutscene 13 - Council Meeting.md`
