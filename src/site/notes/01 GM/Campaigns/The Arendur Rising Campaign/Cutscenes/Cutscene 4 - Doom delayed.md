The goblin yanked his wolf mount hard to the left and split off from his outrider group, circling back to the main force. Darting through trees and shrubs the goblin outrider soon came upon the horde, his little dark heart filled with awe as he stood atop a hill and gazed down upon its might. Before the rider and wolf a huge cloud of dust rolled lazily above the canopy of the blackwoods. A myriad of banners all sporting the red hand symbol waved in the air and thousands of goblins marching underneath them. So many tribes all gathered under the red hand, under the warmasters right hand, Warchief Slythe. They would come upon the Bridge upon darkfall, he needed to inform Slythe that the bridge was down, they would need to adjust their route and delay the bloodshed of Teslions.

....

Warchief Slythe face was a vicious frown as his huge monstrous warg Zjar began chewing and crunching, on the ground lay the headless corpse of the goblin outrider. Slythe held a black orb in his right hand and spoke to it, a soft red glow began to pulse in the center of the orb. "Mazterh, ze bridge iz down, we're going the long roudt. Ozy is mizzin, zum adventurez behind it. Tezlionz will still fall"

....

Amidst white and grey clouds the gushing of air flowing by filled the ears of Jawbreaker as he felt a warm sensation from his message pouch. He reached in for the orb and received Warchief Slythe's report. Jawbreaker snarled in anger "Azyrthalunor, help me find Ozyandor, we need to teach her a lesson. We cannot tolerate failure." He turned his gaze down towards the mountains as a huge blue leathery wing swirled up behind him and the air was filled with a mighty earth quaking roar, sparks of electricity showered throughout the air around them. Then Jawbreaker muttered to himself "I underestimated that band of wannabe heroes, lets hope they try to stand their ground in Teslions" turning his frown into a devilish grin.
