# Deadsquad - Cutscene #10

Jawbreaker materialised in his warcamp, his bodyguard checking the tent at the sound of his arrival. He dismissed them with a wave, but one of them stayed "What is it ?" Jawbreaker impatiently demanded. "The death squad has not checked in, last word was they had set up an ambush. It's been days now." Jawbreaker roared and flipped over a sturdy table with all sorts of papers "That miserable bunch of ... " he could not have this, while discipline held this army together, he did not believe in leadership of entitlement. You had to prove yourself to lead, he needed to show this horde he was still in control. "Warmaster." His train of thought was interrupted "What!" a voice cleared it's throat and one of the spy masters goblins entered the tent "The special transport from Blackspear was supposed to have arrieved, but there is no sign of it yet" the warmaster growled "send word to Saarvith, get a progress report on the circle. Have we uncovered the sigils for the target yet?" the goblin squinted its eyes "we are still working on that warmaster, it is tricky business, well guarded information." Jawbreaker approached the goblin, towered over him "Snikkter better deliver or there will be no rock, no gutter, no cave, no chasm he can hide in that my wrath wont find him, you tell him that."

Jawbreaker sat down again and wondered what foul plans to put into motion to deal with these pesky heroes... "if they are responsible for the transport not getting here, Saarvith, you better not have left anything in that wagon pointing to Blackspear. The last thing i need is for them to keep our lizards from being used."
