The camera pans down from a darkened cloudy sky, a big dark forest looms in the background and the camera settles upon a warcamp in a mountain valley. Many barbaric banners have been posted around the camp, several depicting various units or clans but many of them fly the symbol of the red hand.

Among the many assembled Goblins, trots a huge coal black horse of war with the calm of an eye of a storm. It's hooves, mane and tail are wreathed in purple flames, it's eyes shines with smoldering purple embers. Astride the mount sits dark clothed elven female figure, with the same calm and not even noticing any of the many creatures around her.

Her warhorse trots through the camp until it comes to a halt infront of a wooden construct, a dias and a throne. The camera pans up from the horses hooves, revealing a wooden dias littered with skulls and bones of many different creatures, we come to a halt as we see the foot of the throne and a pair of black plated boots.

A throathy reptillian voice speaks from the throne "Ah, Sunkiller. Should you not be out and about on your errands for those wretched hags? I do not remember any tasks for you yet?". We see the pale elven maid's gaze lift slowly from the dias to the throne, not blinking, unflinching. A sharp piercing voice void of compassion "I am as displeased with my presence here as yourself, i come with news from Bitarra.".

The rolling crackle of a voice answers her "Never displeased Sunkiller, never that. I have the utmost respect for you and your skill. You being here now however, is not according to plan. What news from that watery wench?". Sunkiller answers him with a soft almost childlike voice "Ratbag has fallen, the sunken citadel is lost. Bitarra has seen it for herself through the gift of the hag eye. A band of adventurers out of Arendur, the crimson company. They might even destroy the Gulthias Tree." with a slight undertone of mirth.

"A shame, I had hoped to groom Ratbag into a great general. No matter, we are all but ready to set the HORDE on its march. Ratbag succeeded in gathering enough information. You can inform the hags that Warchief Slythe will be crossing Skull Bridge in about 3 days, I expect them to divert from their little side affairs in order to assist Warchief Saarvith and keep the barrier up on Akacia, whatever it is they are doing on the side for Meg evil eye cannot set back our invasion. Stormshadow was promised full support, i want them to remember that."

Sunkiller does a slight bow, the only movement she has made since entering the camp, as she is making to turn her mount around the man on the throne says in as soft a voice as his reptillian features allow "oh and by the way sun**killer**" the last part of the name emphazised "**your** masters are not the only ones watching, i wonder, what is your interest in that half-elf?" you can almost hear the wicked grin shaping on the last syllables. Sunkillers head snaps up to face the speaker in a flash, red energy crackles from her eyes and red lightning travels down her arm. "Oh ho ho, fear not. I have no reason to betray you to those entropy ridden bitches. That is, unless you give me reason to, you will do well to remember that elf." amusement dripping from every word with a small dose of disturbing laughter in between. Sunkiller seems to realize that she was not in control of her emotions and instantly all energy is extinguished. "Warmaster" she says coldly, her tone inferring he had played his hand well.

Camera fades out as Sunkiller leaves the camp on her coal black steed of war.
