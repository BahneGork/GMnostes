A electric blue mist swirls sluggishly inside a strange room with oddly angled walls, the walls appear smooth like glass and shimmer back and forth between yellow and pink hues. Inside the mist is a dark silhouette, it is humanoid with a big wild mane of hair. The figure walks slowly and purposely out of the mist, which slides off the being revealing a lions face with ruby eyes.

The figure speaks with a deep and smooth voice "Qa'tek! It has begun, the Crystal warrior has been revealed."

From out of one of the walls steps another figure, it looks like a living statue made of pink and purple crystals, it comes to a halt and stands utterly motionless. The figure from the mist approaches the statue and draws forth a ruby the size of a heart, it reaches out to the statues chest and as the ruby comes closer a cavity begins to form in the statue. As the ruby is enclosed inside the statues chest the statue's eyes light up ruby red. The statue begins to take the shape and appearance of a lithe human woman with tar black dreadlocks.

"Qa'tek! Seeker am I, searcher am I, finder of the Crystal Warrior will i be." The statue exclaimed.

The lionfaced figure nodded solemnly and whispered "Eternal be the ruby prison".
