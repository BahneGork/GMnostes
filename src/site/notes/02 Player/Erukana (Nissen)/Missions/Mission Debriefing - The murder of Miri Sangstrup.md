# Mission Debriefing - The murder of Miri Sangstrup

Related: [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Missions/Solve the murder of Miri in Astley\|Solve the murder of Miri in Astley]]

## Mission Debriefing 
- We investigated the site of discovery, found tracks that indicated the body of [[miri sangstrup\|miri sangstrup]] had been dragged into the woods from the city. 
- We did a background check on Miri with her father at the Sangstrup household, where we learned of her fiancee and that she had a close friend in the city, named [[Elvira\|Elvira]]. 
- Investigating the market, asking around about Miri and her possible friend led us to the [[den brækkede knogle\|den brækkede knogle]] tavern where [[Elvira\|Elvira]] worked as a pleasure girl. 
- [[Elvira\|Elvira]] told us she attended a nightly activity on a regular basis, but she did not wish to reveal anymore than that. Upon further encouragement she chose to reveal the name [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] and upon this utterance a terrible curse named [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Journal/The strangle voice curse\|The strangle voice curse]] took effect upon the poor girl. Her heart burst and blood gushed from her mouth. 
- The keep of the tavern [[den brækkede knogle\|den brækkede knogle]] was of no help, she was more concerned with the city guard not showing up. 
- We summoned the memory of Elvira back into her body and asked her 5, not 4 and not 6 questions. 
	- Who killed Miri? :  I do not know 
	- Why was Miri killed?:  She discovered us 
	- Who cursed you to be silent?: Rich lady in a black n red dress  (later to be discovered to be [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lady lucille vitano\|Lady lucille vitano]])
	- What goes on at the secret parties in the warehouse?: [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] throws parties for his cult - [[The cult of the Opal society\|The cult of the Opal society]] 
	- do you know any other names in [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]]'s cult?:  Krugger   (Miri's fiancee)
- The one good information from the keep was that often someone would come to fetch [[Elvira\|Elvira]] and the day we were there she had another appointment 
- We investigated the curse at the city library, see appendix on [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Journal/The strangle voice curse\|The strangle voice curse]] 
- Then we proceeded to wait in Elivra's room for the woman coming to fetch her, we believed it to be the same who had cursed her.
- It was not the same woman, but some girl who had been paid by [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] to come fetch Elivra for him 
- We disguised one of us as Elvira and had the girl escort us to the location, which turned out to be the [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Locations/Alistair estate\|Alistair estate]] 
- our "elvira" went inside and we waited out side for a signal to come in. 
- Once signalled we rushed in to find [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]], [[Lord Steffan blast fingers\|Lord Steffan blast fingers]], [[Lord Marshal Viggo Trenten\|Lord Marshal Viggo Trenten]] and [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lady lucille vitano\|Lady lucille vitano]] attacking our friend with demons, sword and magic. 
	- It would seem that [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] & [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lady lucille vitano\|Lady lucille vitano]] also sent souls to hell. The room in the basement is filled with mirrors that act as a viewing portal to all the souls they have sent there. We saw this in action as [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lady lucille vitano\|Lady lucille vitano]] sent one of our souls there. 
- [[Lord Marshal Viggo Trenten\|Lord Marshal Viggo Trenten]] invoked the name GRAZZT, which we believe to be some kind of Fiend lord, perhaps this is the one they all served 
- [[Lord Steffan blast fingers\|Lord Steffan blast fingers]] was willing to name names of other rich and powerful people involved in the cult club, but Mielikki's divine intervention sent him to the abyss and saved our friend's soul. 
- We have yet to discover at way to save all the souls 
- Further investigation of the [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Locations/Alistair estate\|Alistair estate]] revelaed that the real [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] is a victim as well and his soul is also trapped in hell.  The fiend we encountered has used his form, name and position to further his cultist ends. 


## Conclusion 
[[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] and [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lady lucille vitano\|Lady lucille vitano]] hosted a club - [[The cult of the Opal society\|The cult of the Opal society]] - in the [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Locations/Alistair estate\|Alistair estate]] for the rich and powerful. Here they could indulge in all manner of decadant desires.  
They also collected souls of unfortunate for their fiend lord Grazzt.  
Miri Sangstrup saw what was really going on and she should not have. 
[[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lord Alistair\|Lord Alistair]] turned her fiance [[Krugge\|Krugge]] into a beast to pursue her and kill her. 
[[Krugge\|Krugge]]'s current location is unknown. 
[[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Lady lucille vitano\|Lady lucille vitano]] escaped from the mansion and is perhaps the real power behind [[The cult of the Opal society\|The cult of the Opal society]]
