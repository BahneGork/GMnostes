# The Ancient Grove
<span data-category='orange' data-calendar="Ceynor" data-date='1517-Ches-12' data-date-end='1517-Ches-12' data-img='Inline Example/Event_2.jpg' data-name='The Ancient Grove'></span>
[[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Characters/Vargoth Sul\|vargoth]] and [[Isilme\|Isilme]] spend some time exploring the grove and its surroundings in greater detail. They soon discover that the grove is in a dormant state—slumbering due to the absence of a caretaker, most likely the shaman who once lived in the hut above.

In an attempt to reawaken the grove, Vargoth and Isilme perform a ritual. In a small clay bowl, they offer a few strands of hair, a drop of blood, and some plants they carry with them. Then, Vargoth casts Cure Wounds on one of the central stones encircling the small pool at the grove’s heart. The healing energy spreads like ripples across the stones, and the ancient symbols carved into them begin to glow with a soft, pale blue light.

They sit down together and enter a meditative state, softly humming a rhythmic chant.

At first, the runes pulse faintly, then with increasing brightness—like the heartbeat of the world itself. Moss and mushrooms release a heady harmony of scent and sound that gently pulls the mind into focus. This resonance spreads through the entire cavern, washing over the group like a lullaby. One by one, each of you grows drowsy, your thoughts slowing until, eventually, sleep claims you all.

In your dreams, you witness strange visions—fragments of stories not your own. You see echoes of battles, choices made in other lives, alternate paths your souls might have taken. Some are clear, others veiled in mystery. You move through these scenes not as passive observers, but as participants—your bodies moving with clarity, your minds absorbing lessons as if through lived experience.

Throughout the dream, a golden mist lingers at the edges of your vision, and a low, harmonic hum surrounds you. It’s like Vargoth and Isilme’s chant—but amplified, as if sung by a hundred voices from deep within the earth.

When you awaken, you feel completely restored—as though you’ve slept for weeks, yet you’re brimming with energy. More than that, something has changed. The muscle memory of sword strokes you never swung. The recall of arcane gestures you don’t remember learning. The wisdom of paths walked only in dreams.

Each of you has grown. Not through study, sparring, or meditation—but through something deeper. The grove has gifted you more than rest. It has whispered truths to your souls.

I har hver fået 7.830 xp og er nu level 8. Som følge af drømmen så gælder det som I har trænet det level.

The journey continues:

With the ancient grove briefly stirred from its slumber, a pulse of life returned to the land—if only for a fleeting moment. After a day of rest and strange dreams beneath its glowing runes, the party sensed the magic fading once more, the grove slipping back into quiet dormancy without a guardian to tend it.

But something had changed. The scroll—dormant for days—now pulsed with faint warmth, and the magical compass etched upon it spun slowly before locking in a steady direction. The path forward had returned.

Bjørn, ever eager to move, led the way with sword in hand and steam rising from his breath in the cold. Isilme followed close behind, sensing the last whispers of the grove’s energy in the wind. Logan, silent and watchful, kept to the flanks with bow at the ready. Vargoth, the earth-touched cleric, walked with purpose, his connection to the land reaffirmed. And Winston, stalwart as ever, marched forward with shield gleaming in the winter sun.

Their journey took them across days of snow-covered steppe—quiet, vast, and empty. No beasts, no travelers, only the sound of boots crunching ice and the occasional whisper of wind. But eventually, a line of trees emerged on the horizon: a dark, frost-bitten forest standing as the last barrier before a looming mountainside.

The compass still points forward. The journey continues.
