We found the [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Journal/Brakeshield Statue\|Brakeshield Statue]] here, in the posession of [[Archibald Oddsmoke\|Archibald Oddsmoke]] 

We let [[Archibald Oddsmoke\|Archibald Oddsmoke]] examine/study it for a few days before it was handed over to us and we left the village, heading back to [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/Locations/The Bronze Keg\|The Bronze Keg]] .
