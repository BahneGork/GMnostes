# Diary of Clarabel Lancaster 

6th of Flamerule in the Barony of Eresby
We travelled back to [[Kegville\|Kegville]] from our latest job, procuring [[The Silver statue heirloom\|The Silver statue heirloom]] for the [[Brakeshield Family\|Brakeshield Family]]. When we came upon an ambush scene, Red Tooth orcs had ambushed another of [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Vaelon Dunmere\|Vaelon Dunmere]] 's groups. We tracked some smaller footprints hoping to find someone alive.

We did not. But we did find a [[No Graph/5e Reference/monsters/Kobold\|Kobold]] clan, that we had to fight when negotiations failed.

The caves and tunnels were also home to a terrible thing "[[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/hviskeren i mørket\|hviskeren i mørket]]", some spider creature. It wanted us to take care of [[den store stemme\|den store stemme]], which turned out to be the Kobold's shamanic leader. 

[[den store stemme\|den store stemme]] was reading from a book of dark speak and performing a dark ritual or just rambling dark speach. It came to a head and we fought the thing, as it died it exploded in dark energy. Obsidian gems were either embedded in its skin or growing from it, was hard to tell but they were the source of the explosion. 

If Nibar hadn't survived that explosion and used my healing kit on us, we would have perished in those caves.

We found some ancient barred dwarven doors and [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/hviskeren i mørket\|hviskeren i mørket]] told us that it knows about those dwarven halls.

The kobold leader had all the belongings of the dead adventurer group, among those were an odd piece. An hour glass with blue sand, held between two bands that could revolve around it.
