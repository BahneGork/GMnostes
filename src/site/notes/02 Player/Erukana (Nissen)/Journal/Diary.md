# Diary of Clarabel Lancaster 

6th of Flamerule in the Barony of Eresby
We travelled back to [[Kegville\|Kegville]] from our latest job, procuring [[The Silver statue heirloom\|The Silver statue heirloom]] for the [[Brakeshield Family\|Brakeshield Family]]. When we came upon an ambush scene, Red Tooth orcs had ambushed another of [[02 Player/Erukana (Nissen)/People/Vaelon Dunmere\|Vaelon Dunmere]] 's groups. We tracked some smaller footprints hoping to find someone alive.

We did not. But we did find a [[No Graph/5e Reference/monsters/Kobold\|Kobold]] clan, that we had to fight when negotiations failed.
