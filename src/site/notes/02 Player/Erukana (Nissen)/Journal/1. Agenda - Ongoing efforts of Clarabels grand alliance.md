Logan can act as an infiltrator that searches for and gathers intelligence. 
- He is careless and disregarding of social etiquette and a bad liar. 
- Therefore, Logan is not suited for persuasion or direct deception. 
- He can craft an undeniable identity to get into places and investigate, but will most likely easily be caught in a lie or fail at coaxing information from people directly.
- Finding things and putting clues together is his forte.
