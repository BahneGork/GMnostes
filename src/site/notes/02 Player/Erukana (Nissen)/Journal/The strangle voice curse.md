The Stranglevoice curse is mentioned in **the 666 volumes of the Demonifica Arcana** and is part of **the Nine Curses of immortal torments**.

**Origin:** Unknown but speculated to originate from the **kingdom of Sestanya**.
 
**Obtainment:** Used by powerful arcanist well versed in spells and incantations that involves demonic magic. To be given access to one of the Nine Curses of Immortal Torments, one *must have sacrificed something truly valuable – such as several souls, as well as having a heart that is irredeemably black and withered*.

You can learn the ritual from the 666 volumes of Demonifica Arcana, though which volume that specifies is unknown. When prepared and performed, the ritual allows for a visit from one of the Lords of the Abyss, who will teach this curse to a worthy supplicant.
 
**Effect:** The spell is used upon a victim, to ensure the persons silence on a matter that the caster specifies upon the victim. Should the victim break the silence on the matter, they will *die in a truly horrific and grotesque manner*, visually disturbing to all who might be present at the time of death.

However, the death is not just for their mortal bodies. Their souls are sent to the Lord of the Abyss that gave the spell to the caster, where an eternity of torment will be visited upon the unfortunate victim.

The victim is entirely aware of this fate. Thus, it is quite understandable that the very few – read none known at this time – have chosen to break the silence, no matter what torture was visited upon them. A death by pain, even torment is far better than one of eternal torment at the hands of vile demons and devils.

There has yet to be found a successful way of breaking the curse upon a victim.
