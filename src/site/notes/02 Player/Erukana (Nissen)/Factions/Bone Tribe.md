# History
Long ago the Bone tribe was known as the Elk tribe, but a great battle decimated the tribe. 
The tribe leader at the time, made a pact with "something" which we believe was the purple plague and survived the ordeal. 

The tribe's shamens are the bone mothers, they worship the god of death which is anti-life. 

The tribe are racists against elves
