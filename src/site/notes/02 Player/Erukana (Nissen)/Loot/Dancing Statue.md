Relic Name: Alunethriel’s Grace

The statue is a breathtaking depiction of a tall, slender elf in mid-dance, her form seemingly captured in a single, eternal moment of grace. Her arms arc fluidly above her head, her face serene with closed eyes, and her feet appear to barely touch the pedestal, as though she might take flight. Subtle carvings around the base evoke swirling winds and faintly glowing runes reminiscent of elven song.

Powers: 
When attuned to the group, Alunethriel’s Grace grants the following benefits to its bonded wielder(s):

Rejuvenation of the Soul:
During a short or long rest, the statue emits a soothing aura, allowing all within a 30-foot radius to recover an additional hit die’s worth of health and an extra spell slot (up to 3rd level). 

Harmonic Resonance:
Once per long rest, a user attuned to the statue can invoke its power as an action. This restores 1d8 + their proficiency bonus in hit points to all allies within 15 feet and grants temporary hit points equal to half the amount healed. 

Weaver’s Song:
The statue carries an echo of The Ancient’s magic. A spellcaster attuned to the statue can reroll a failed concentration check once per long rest.

Ethereal Waltz (Optional/Unlockable - Unlocked by the group):
After extended attunement (e.g., 1 month of use or upon completing a quest tied to The Ancient), the statue grants the ability to cast Greater Restoration once per week without material components.

The Lost Flute of Alunethriel

Amidst the ruins, the players discover a beautifully preserved starwood flute, seemingly untouched by time. Inscribed upon it in elegant elvish script are words that translate to:

"WHEN THE WORLD FALTERS, SING THE FIRST NOTES OF HOPE."

Upon playing the flute, the hall reverberates with a ghostly melody, revealing an illusory vision of Alunethriel’s final dance. In this haunting projection, she stands in a similar hall, surrounded by her people as she weaves her last spell to protect the enclave. Her voice, soft yet resolute, speaks:

"IF MY SONG ENDURES, SO TOO DOES THE PROMISE OF LIGHT. TO THOSE WHO FIND THIS FLUTE, KNOW THAT DARKNESS CAN NEVER FULLY SMOTHER THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD. GO NOW AND CARRY MY HOPE."

The flute becomes an artifact tied to ALUNETHRIEL’S GRACE, unlocking its ETHEREAL WALTZ power when the two are reunited.
