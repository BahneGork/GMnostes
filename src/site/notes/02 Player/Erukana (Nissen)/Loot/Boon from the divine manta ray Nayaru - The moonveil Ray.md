# Boon from the Divine Manta Ray Nayaru - The Moonveil Ray


## Description
Nayaru has granted the party a fragment of its ancient wisdom and power. This boon manifests as a mystical connection between party members and provides the following benefits: 
- The currently party members are those with the boon and as such are “attuned” to the boon. They are called Moonveilers. 
- Common for the effects are that once one Moonveiler has used it, it cannot be used again until after a long rest, no matter how many Moonveilers are attuned. 

 
## Shared Depths of Magic
A spellcasting Moonveiler in the party can cast a spell they know/has prepared and is from a 1st level spell list into the boon. Any Moonveiler – spellcaster or not - can then cast that stored spell from the mystical connection using the required action for the spell. The casted spell is using the original caster's spell attack bonus and spell save DC. The spell remains stored until used or until a new spell is stored (replacing the previous one). The spell otherwise works as normal. A target is not limited to only Moonveilers. 

## Shared Spirit
A Moonveiler within 100 ft of another Moonveiler can use the reaction action and choose to take half the damage instead, meaning both Moonveilers take half the damage. Immunities, resistances and other effects that can reduce the taken damage still apply. 

## Dimensional Breach
A Moonveiler can use a bonus action to tear open two temporary rifts in reality, channeling Nayaru’s' power. 

You create linked teleportation portals that remains open for up to 1 minute without requiring concentration to maintain. Choose two points on solid ground that you can see, one point within **10 feet of you**and one point within **5 feet of another Moonveiler** – distance between the two points **cannot excess 120 feet**. 

A manta ray-shaped portal, 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the effect fails, and the use is lost. 

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular (standing upwards) to it at the points you choose. A ring is **visible only from one side** (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal. 

The Moonveiler using the effect can **chose any number of creatures, he or she can see**, and include them into the effect (other Moonveilers are automatically included) as valid creatures for using the portals. 

Any valid creatures entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On his or her turn, a Moonveiler (and only a Moonveiler) can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction. 

The main purpose of this effect is mainly for one Moonveiler (or valid creature) to quickly come and aid another ally or reposition himself/herself closer to an ally.


**FAQ:**
• Will a upcasted 1st level spell work. Yes, as long as the spell is from the 1st level spell list. 
• Will a 1st level raise dead work? Yes, if you can get a DM to grant you the spell as such one. You might need to be one of Mystra’s chosen ones, have Tymora’s blessing or even the fortune of Waukeen. 
• Is the once per long rest for shared depth of magic both the storage and using? A spell can be stored and/or cast once per long rest, meaning between two long rests you have one store and one cast. 
• Can you shoot and arrow or attack spell through the breach? Yes, but if your goal is to hit someone through the portal, the attack is with disadvantage and the range is reduced by the 5 feet. 
• Can you use a touch spell through the portal? Yes, but if it is an attack, you have disadvantage on the attack. 
• Will the breach grant cover? Yes by 3/4. 
• Will the breach obscure sight? Yes, you cannot see through it, and will break line of sight if standing in front of it and is not taller/wider than the portal. 
• Can I throw another creature through the portal? Only if it is a willing creature (charmed or similar do not work) and range is reduced by 5 feet.
