# Boon from the divine manta ray Nayaru - The moonveil Ray


## Description
Nayaru has granted the party a fragment of its ancient wisdom and power. This boon manifests as a mystical connection between party members and provides the following benefits: Common for the effects are that once a party member has used it, it cannot be used again until after a long rest, no matter how many party members there are. 

The currently party members are those with the boon and as such are “attuned” to the boon. They are called Moonveilers. 

#### Shared Depths of Magic: 
Once per long rest, a spellcasting Moonveiler in the party can cast a spell they know/has prepared and is from a 1st level spell list into the boon. Any Moonveiler – spellcaster or not - can then cast that stored spell from the mystical connection using the required action for the spell. The casted spell is using the original caster's spell attack bonus and spell save DC. The spell remains stored until used or until a new spell is stored (replacing the previous one). The spell otherwise works as normal and can use used upon any non Moonveiler. 

#### Shared Spirit: 
Once per long rest, a Moonveiler within 100 ft of another Moonveiler can use the reaction action and choose to take half the damage instead, meaning both Moonveilers take half the damage. Immunities, resistances and other effects that can reduce the taken damage still apply. 

#### Dimensional Breach: 
Once per long rest, a Moonveiler can use a bonus action to tear open two temporary rifts in reality, channeling Nayaru’s' power. 

#### Mechanics: 
The activating Moonveiler creates two manta ray-shaped portals: One portal appears within 5 feet of the activating Moonveiler One portal appears within 5 feet of another ally within 120 feet Each portal is about 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall, shimmering with otherworldly energy The portals are connected - anything entering one immediately exits the other Movement through the portal costs 5 feet of movement The breach lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed as a bonus action by any Moonveiler within 120 feet of one of the portals. 

#### Limitations: 
The ally must be within 120 feet and visible to the activating Moonveiler (and Line of Sight) Portals cannot appear inside solid objects or creatures – in such case it fails If either location would be dangerous (like on lava), the ability fails Both portals need to be on solid ground (frozen water and inside wagon/on ship etc works) Only willing allies (charmed or similar do not work) and objects can pass through – also objects from enemies The portals shed dim light in a 5-foot radius with blue-green manta ray-song energy

**FAQ:**
• Will a upcasted 1st level spell work. Yes, as long as the spell is from the 1st level spell list. 
• Will a 1st level raise dead work? Yes, if you can get a DM to grant you the spell as such one. You might need to be one of Mystra’s chosen ones, have Tymora’s blessing or even the fortune of Waukeen. 
• Is the once per long rest for shared depth of magic both the storage and using? A spell can be stored and/or cast once per long rest, meaning between two long rests you have one store and one cast. 
• Can you shoot and arrow or attack spell through the breach? Yes, but if your goal is to hit someone through the portal, the attack is with disadvantage and the range is reduced by the 5 feet. 
• Can you use a touch spell through the portal? Yes, but if it is an attack, you have disadvantage on the attack. 
• Will the breach grant cover? Yes by 3/4. 
• Will the breach obscure sight? Yes, you cannot see through it, and will break line of sight if standing in front of it and is not taller/wider than the portal. 
• Can I throw another creature through the portal? Only if it is a willing creature (charmed or similar do not work) and range is reduced by 5 feet.
